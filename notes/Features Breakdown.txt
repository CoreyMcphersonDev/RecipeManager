ARTWORK NEEDED:

		-stars

	>Rating of recipe difficulty emblems(1-3)
		-Cooking utensils (knives?)
			Different depending on level of difficulty
				1 Knife looks happy, 3 knives are sweaty and working hard?

	>PHOTOS OF FOOD

PROBLEMS:
	-No mobile version...must print hard copy of grocery list.

	-Different people like to order/categorize their lists in different ways
		(Possible to use Kroger API to pull aisle locations to help organize lists?)
			((add option to start from either side of grocery store))
	-Store Membership integration?
		How to display costs by default?
			Once user account is linked with Kroger card (etc.) only show discounted prices?
				Always show differences in prices? (regular cost vs membership cost)
	-Recipes
		Recipes included should also have a button to instantly add ingredients from chosen recipes
			to grocery list

	-Creating Meals
		Must build flux into this logic - pizza can and can't include many different things...
